    <p>
        My interest in web development is what got me into this degree. I have been interested in the structural buildings of a website and how to design them. I enjoy the design aspect the most, but learning how to interconnect a database and incorporate Javascript will also be very useful.
    </p>
    <h4>What I hope to learn:</h4>
    <ul> 
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Website structure</li>
        <li>How to connect a database to a website</li>
    </ul>
